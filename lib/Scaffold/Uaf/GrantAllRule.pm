=head1 NAME

Scaffold::Uaf::GrantAllRule - A rule that grants permission to do everything.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Scaffold::Uaf::GrantAllRule is a pre-built rule that grants access for
all permission requests. This rule can be used to help implement a system that
has a default policy of allowing access, and to which you add rules that deny
access for specific cases.

Note that the loose type checking of Perl makes this inherently dangerous, 
since a typo is likely to fail to deny access. It is recommended that you
take the opposite approach with your rules, since a typo will err on the 
side of denying access. The former is a security hole, the latter is a bug
that people will complain about (so you can fix it).
