=head1 NAME

Scaffold::Uaf::Rule - A base class for rules.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Each rule is a custom-written class that implements some aspect of your site's
access logic. Rules can choose to grant or deny a request. 

 package Sample::Test;

 use strict;
 use warnings;

 use base qw(Scaffold::Uaf::Rule);

 sub grants($$$$) {

     my $self = shift;
     my $user = shift;
     my $action = shift;
     my $resource = shift;

     if ($action eq "edit" && $resource->isa("sample::Record")) {

        return 1 if ($user->username eq "root");

     }

     return 0;

 }

 sub denies($$$$) {

     return 0;
 
 }

 1;

The Authorize object will only give permission if I<at least> one rule grants
permission, I<and no> rule denies it. 

It is important that your rules never grant or deny a request they do not
understand, so it is a good idea to use type checking to prevent strangeness.
B<Assertions should not be used> if you expect different rules to accept
different resource types or user types, since each rule is used on every access
request.
