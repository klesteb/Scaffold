Revision history for Scaffold

0.01    14-Jul-2010 K.Esteb
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
        svn log -r 1:84

0.02    23-Jul-2010 K.Esteb
        Improved the exception handling within the Uaf modules. It should
        not allow a resource to remain locked if an exception occurs.
        svn log -r 85:88

0.03    05-Sep-2010 K.Esteb
        Added Lockmgr/UnixMutex.pm and made it the default lock manager.
        Improved the look of the example web site.
        svn log -r 89:114

0.04    17-Sep-2010 K.Esteb
        Fixed Lockmgr/UnixMutex.pm so that the named resources are stored in
        shared memory, instead of a hash within the object.
        svn log -r 115:119

0.05    24-Feb-2011 K.Esteb
        Added Scaffold::Routes to parse the URL using regex. Should be
        more flexiable now. At least the dispatching logic is now simpler.
        svn log -r 120:129

0.06    02-Apr-2011 K.Esteb
        Changed when the scaffold object is injected into handlers. This 
        now happens when they are initiated instead of when they are being 
        called. 
        Fixed a minor error with routes. Routes can now be like this:
          qr{!/login$|^/login/(\w+)$}
        And they will parse correctly. 
        Removed all undef's from the parameter array returned from
        routes.
        svn log -r 130:148

0.07    15-Jun-2011 K.Esteb
        Started to implement the caching of static template output. 
        The invocation of the method within the handler now uses 
        lower case for the method name.
        Changed several instances where "unless" was being used instead
        of "if" when checking for held locks.
        svn log -r 149:160

0.08    10-Nov-2011 K.Esteb
        Fixed a problem where the cache was not being cleared correctly,
          Cache/FastMmap.pm was using the wrong set() method.
        Fixed returning an uninitialized value in Routes.pm
        Fixed an error message in UnixMutex.pm
        svn log -r 161:167

0.09    22-Dec-2011 K.Esteb
        Rewrote UnixMutex.pm to work properly. This should resolve
        problems with ramdom lockup and semaphore errors.
        svn log -r 168:170

0.10    23-Apr-2012 K.Esteb
        Added the setting of gid, uid and mode within UnixMutex.pm. This
          should resolve the problem of the semaphore and shared memory
          segmenets being removed under RHEL v5.*.
        svn log -r 171:177
