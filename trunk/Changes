Revision history for Scaffold

0.01    14-Jul-2010 K.Esteb
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
        svn log -r 1:84

0.02    23-Jul-2010 K.Esteb
        Improved the exception handling within the Uaf modules. It should
        not allow a resource to remain locked if an exception occurs.
        svn log -r 85:88

0.03    05-Sep-2010 K.Esteb
        Added Lockmgr/UnixMutex.pm and made it the default lock manager.
        Improved the look of the example web site.
        svn log -r 89:114

0.04    17-Sep-2010 K.Esteb
        Fixed Lockmgr/UnixMutex.pm so that the named resources are stored in
        shared memory, instead of a hash within the object.
        svn log -r 115:119

0.05    24-Feb-2011 K.Esteb
        Added Scaffold::Routes to parse the URL using regex. Should be
        more flexiable now. At least the dispatching logic is now simpler.
        svn log -r 120:129
